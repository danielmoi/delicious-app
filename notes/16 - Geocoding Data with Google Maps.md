- let's use Google Maps!

- create new Project
- get new API key
- enable the PLACES library!

- put it into variables.env
- restart server

- now we instantiate a new google places object
- and then we add a google event listener, so that when any SUBSEQUENT clicks on the places dropdown occurs, we will replace the values of our inputs!

- we need to hook up a function to stop the form being submitted on pressing the Enter key
