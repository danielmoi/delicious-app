- let's create a new table Users

- Passport
- will help us create user accounts without writing a whole lot of boiler plate code

- validate
- 1. how to validate it
- 2. what to do if it fails validation

- we need to be able to store a password in the database
- but we want to store a HASH of that password
- to do that we will use passport JS


- to generate a random string, we can use a built-in Node module, called CRYPTO!

- and then we actually need to add those fields on our Schema!!!!
