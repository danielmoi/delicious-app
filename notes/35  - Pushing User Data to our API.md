- adding the heart to our store card
- it's probably good to add a FORM TAG
- this is because whenever you are submitting data, that way, if JS fails, it will STILL WORK!!!!

- we use button beacuse we can't have HTML inside an <a> tag

- then we make the route to handle our hearting!


- in order to update the classes (heart count and heart color), because we don't have DOM updating, we are using a cheeky toggle function... and then using bling/jQuery to grab the relevant elements!
